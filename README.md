# Enjin-BBCode-Creator
A BBcode creator for Enjin, entirely written in Python

Use this program to generate BBCode for colourised, bold, italicised, underlined and strikethroughed text of different sizes, suitable for putting in Enjin posts.

It does require some dependencies, those being pyperclip and easygui. These can both be installed using `pip`.

This program should work across all platforms.

If you have any suggestions or issues with the program, open the issue tracker and create a new issue.

Enjoy!
